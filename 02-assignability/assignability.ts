/**
 * Assignability.
 *
 * introduce:
 * - the concept of assignability
 * - assignability of literals and primitive types.
 * - assignability of arrays and tuples
 * - assignability of objects
 * - assignability of unions
 * - assignability of functions
 *
 * With simple examples of assigning variables of different types.
 *
 * - the concept and syntax of type constraints, in generic types, and generic functions
 *  - Type constraints are a way to:
 *      - restrain the input type of a function, will keeping it generic
 *      - Give the compiler more information about type parameters.
 *
 *
 * Note: using any in a constraint isn't unsafe
