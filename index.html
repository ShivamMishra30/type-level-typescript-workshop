  <h2>Welcome to our workshop on type-level typescript.</h2>

  <p>
    It's a workshop on type-level programming, so we won't do any
    web-development. You can maximize the code tabs and reduce "Browser" &
    "Tests" tabs.
  </p>
  You can now open README.md and the first exercise in
  00-introduction/exercise.ts.
