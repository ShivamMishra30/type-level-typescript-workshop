 *
 * introduce:
 * - how to concatenate 2 union types
 * - how to filter a union type
 *   - this is a good reminder of `never`, the empty union type
 *     and how we can use it to our advantage.
 * - How conditional types distribute union members over their branches
 * - How you can use this to map over a union type
